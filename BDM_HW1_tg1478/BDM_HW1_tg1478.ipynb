    "Your task is to <b>compute the median age</b> of the Citibike’s <b>subscribed</b> customers, aka. usertype is \"Subscriber\". You are required to read data line by line and are not allowed to store the entire data set in memory. Indeed, you should not have any containers (e.g. list, dictionary, DataFrame, etc.) with more than a handful, e.g. strictly < 100, of elements in memory either as a local or a global variable. You can use the citibike.csv data file that we have on NYU Classes for testing, but we will evaluate your code on a much larger input to ensure it’s streaming capability.\n",

    "The code block below is taken mostly from our lab and would stream data from the citibike.csv for on-demand processing. The data file should be stored on the same folder with this notebook. You will need to replace the portion inside the for loop with your own code."

The data stream is sorted based on starting times (similar to the <b>citibike.csv</b> file uploaded on NYU Classes). The first ride of the day is interpreted as the ride with the earliest starting time of a day. For the sample data, which is a week worth of citibike records, your generator should only generate 7 items (one for each day).\n",

You can think of this generator as a filter only passing certain records out."
